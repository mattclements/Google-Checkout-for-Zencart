GOOGLE CHECKOUT Automatic shipping generator v0.2

INTRODUCTION
============
	
	The idea of this script is to automaticaly get all the shipping quotes you have
	setted up in your ecommerce installation. This should be used if in the Google
	Checkout button you see an Error message saying the some shipping methods are
	not configured or if you are using some shipping modules that are not the 
	default ones.	
	
INSTALLATION NOTES
==================
A
	0. Upack files in zencart_dir/googlecheckout/shipping_generator/
	1. Point your browser to http://your-site/googlecheckout/shipping_generator/
	2. Set a Domestic Address and an Int'l Address (you can use default ones)
	3. Click Get Shipping Methods
	4. Wait for the script to use Zencart's Shipping class to get all valid shipping 
			methods for those adresses. 
			(Note: Only active shipping providers and valid	shipping methods for the 
			address setted will be shown. May happen that one shipping method 
			available is not present. Is recommended to check all generated methods 
			and delete those ones you don't want or need. Double check the Fancy names
			because many times a date is added to them.)
	5. When you have all the methods you want to offer, click Generate

	6. This will generate some php code. You must see the 
			$mc_shipping_methods and $mc_shipping_methods_names
	7. Replace this code in the file /googlecheckout/shipping_methods.php
	8. If you are not sure what you are doing, is recommended to do a merge from 
	    the original file and the one created.
	    
	Note that some shipping methods may not be created, such as *freeshipper* or
	 *freeoptions*. Since they dont apply to the generic cart used to get quotes.

  The recomended Default value is the cost that is recommended to setup in the
   Admin UI -> Modules -> Payment -> GC, Default Values for Real Time Shipping Rates.
