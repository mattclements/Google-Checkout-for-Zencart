GOOGLE CHECKOUT PLUGIN FOR ZEN CART v1.0.1 - 10/03/2006

INTRODUCTION
============
The Google Checkout module for Zen Cart adds Google Checkout as a Checkout Module within Zen Cart.
This will allow merchants using Zen Cart to offer Google Checkout as an alternate checkout method.
The plugin provides Level 2 integration of Google Checkout with Zen Cart.

Plugin features include:
1. Posting shopping carts to Google Checkout
2. Shipping support (Currently, flat rates, item rates and table rates are supported)
3. Tax support
4. User and order updates within Zen Cart
5. Order processing using Zen Cart Admin UI 


REQUIREMENTS
============
Zen Cart v1.3.5 (released 04-Sept-2006)
PHP3 or PHP4 or PHP5 with cURL(libcurl) installed and enabled


INSTALLATION NOTES
==================
Follow instructions contained in the INSTALLATION file.
Verify the installation from the Admin site and selecting MODULES->PAYMENTS and checking if Google Checkout is listed as a payment option.


SETUP ON ADMIN UI
=================
Select and install the Google Checkout payment module. The following are some of the fields you can update:

1. Enable/Disable: Enable this to use Google Checkout for your site.
2. Merchant ID and Merchant Key:(Mandatory) If any of these are not set and the module is enabled, a disabled (gray) Checkout button appears on the Checkout page. 
   Set these values from your seller Google account under the Settings->Integration tab.
3. Operation Mode: Test your site with Google Checkout's sandbox server before migrating to production. You will need it signup for a separate Google Checkout sandbox account at http://sandbox.google.com/sell. Your sandbox account will have a different Merchant ID and Merchant Key. When you are ready to run against the production server, remember to update your merchant ID and key when migrating.
4. Shipping Options: Select the shipping options to be supported.
   If the shipping tax rates differ, a disabled Checkout button will appear on the Checkout page.

Your Google Checkout setup page is correct if, upon viewing it, a non-disabled Google Checkout button appears.


TRACKING USERS AND ORDERS
=========================
In order to provide this support (as required for Level 2 integration), update the API callback request field in the seller account to https://<url-site-url>/admin/googlecheckout/responsehandler.php . Note that the production Checkout server requires an SSL callback site.
The Sandbox server accepts non SSL callback URLs.

View your Google Checkout customers and their orders in the Reports tab. 
For each order, the default starting state is PENDING. 
The state changes to PROCESSING and DELIVERED as follows; corresponding messages will be sent out to the Checkout server for order processing.

| Original State | New State  | Action                         |  Customer Notification    |
| PENDING        | PROCESSING | charging the order             |  Processing order message |
| PROCESSING     | DELIVERED  | marking the order for delivery |  Shipped order message    |

Any comments added during state change will be sent to the buyer account page if you have selected the Append Comments option.

All request and response messages will be logged to the file admin/googlecheckout/response_message.log.
In case an order payment is declined or an order is cancelled(by Google or otherwise), you can add code to admin/googlecheckout/responsehandler.php for any specific actions you need to take.
