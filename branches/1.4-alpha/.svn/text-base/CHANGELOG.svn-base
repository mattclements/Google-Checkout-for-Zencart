wont fix:
    - Issue: GC button disabled if using multiple shipping methods each with different tax schedules.
    GC restriction, wont fix
    - Issue: Timeout errors often occur when several MC shipping methods are enabled or multiple shipping options.
    GC restriction, wont fix
    - Wish: Much improved support for text based email notifications from Google Checkout (formatting is unprofessional, missing line feeds at natural line break locations, URL links are not included, etc.) 
    GC should fix, notes sent to support team
